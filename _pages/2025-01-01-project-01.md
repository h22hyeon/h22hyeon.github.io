title: "Project 01 — Robust Evaluation Protocol for Multimodal Safety"
date: 2025-01-01
summary: "A measurement-first protocol to stress-test multimodal systems under distribution shift and adversarial prompting."
objective: "Define a reproducible evaluation harness that isolates failure modes and reduces false positives."
approach: "Curate test suites → define graders/metrics → run controlled ablations → publish artifacts."
outputs: "Benchmark suite, analysis report, and reference implementation."
